6, Statically typed programming languages are languages where the data types of variables are explicitly declared at compile-time and cannot be changed during runtime. Some programming languages in this category are C++, C, Java, TypeScript etc. 
Dynamically typed programming languages, on the other hand, are languages where the data types of variables are inferred at runtime, and can be changed during program execution. The programing languages in this category are JavaScript, PHP, Python,Ruby etc.

7, Even though Null and Undefined all represent the absence of a value, they are totally different. Undefined indicates when the datatype has been declared but has not been assigned a value but with null, it indicates the datatype has been deliberately assigned to a non-value making it look like the object does not exist.
